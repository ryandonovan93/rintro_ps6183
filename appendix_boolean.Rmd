# Appendix - Understanding Boolean Operators in the Context of `filter()`

In the Chapter 5, I brushed over what the operators `<` and `&`, and `|` meant and what they were actually doing in R. Each of these operators are known as Boolean operators in R.

Boolean operators are logical operators used in programming to combine or modify conditions, resulting in either **`TRUE`** or **`FALSE`** outcomes. In the context of data cleaning in R, Boolean operators help us construct conditions to select specific rows from a data frame based on certain criteria. When using **`filter()`**, R evaluates each row in the data frame against the specified conditions, determining whether each row meets the criteria and should be retained or not.

## How Boolean Operators Work:

-   **Logical AND (`&`):** The **`&`** operator evaluates to **`TRUE`** only if both conditions on either side of the operator are **`TRUE`**. In the context of **`filter()`**, rows are retained if they satisfy **all** conditions joined by **`&`**. For example, **`filter(df, x > 5 & y < 10)`** will retain rows where **`x`** is greater than **`5`** **and** **`y`** is less than **`10`**.

-   **Logical OR (`|`):** The **`|`** operator evaluates to **`TRUE`** if **at least one** of the conditions on either side of the operator is **`TRUE`**. In the context of **`filter()`**, rows are retained if they satisfy **any** of the conditions joined by **`|`**. For example, **`filter(df, x > 5 | y < 10)`** will retain rows where **`x`** is greater than **`5`** **or** **`y`** is less than **`10`**.

-   **Logical NOT (`!`):** The **`!`** operator negates a condition, converting **`TRUE`** to **`FALSE`** and vice versa. In the context of **`filter()`**, **`!`** can be used to exclude rows that satisfy a particular condition. For example, **`filter(df, !(x == 5))`** will exclude rows where **`x`** equals **`5`**.

### Understanding R's Evaluation Process:

When applying **`filter()`** with Boolean operators, R sequentially evaluates each row in the data frame against the specified conditions. If a row satisfies **all** conditions joined by **`&`**, or **any** condition joined by **`|`**, it is retained in the filtered data frame. Rows that do not meet the specified criteria are excluded from the output.

The following table summarises the main Boolean operators we would use in R

| Operator/Condition | Description                                                                   | Example                                                                                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| `==`               | Checks if two values are equal.                                               | `x == 5` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` equals `5`.                                                |
| `!=`               | Checks if two values are not equal.                                           | `x != 5` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` does not equal `5`.                                        |
| `>`                | Checks if one value is greater than another.                                  | `x > 5` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` is greater than `5`.                                        |
| `<`                | Checks if one value is less than another.                                     | `x < 5` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` is less than `5`.                                           |
| `>=`               | Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.                      | `x >= 5` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` is greater than or equal to `5`.                           |
| `<=`               | Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.                         | `x <= 5` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` is less than or equal to `5`.                              |
| `&`                | Logical AND operator; evaluates to `TRUE` only if both conditions are `TRUE`. | `(x > 5) & (y < 10)` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` is greater than `5` AND `y` is less than `10`. |
| `|`                | Logical OR operator; evaluates to `TRUE` if at least one condition is `TRUE`. | `(x > 5) \| (y < 10)` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` is greater than `5` OR `y` is less than `10`. |
| `!`                | Logical NOT operator; negates a condition.                                    | `!(x == 5)` evaluates to `TRUE` if `x` is not equal to `5`.                                    |
