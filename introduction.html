<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dr Ryan Donovan and Dr Ciara Egan.</p>
<p>This is the textbook for the Advanced Research Methods module PS6183. This textbook will introduce the R programming language and describe how to use R to import, clean, process, and visualize psychological data. No prior knowledge of R or any other programming language or statistical software is required for this module. All textbook materials are used for educational purposes only and should only be shared within the University of Galway’s School of Psychology.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What will I learn to do in R?<a href="#what-will-i-learn-to-do-in-r" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to import a file with quantitative data into R, clean it, run descriptive and inferential statistics, generate nice visualisations, and output your results.</p>
<p>The learning objectives of this course are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn how to import and create datasets in R.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn and apply basic programming concepts such as data types, functions, and loops.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn key techniques for data cleaning in R to enable statistical analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to create APA-standard graphs in R.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to deal with errors or bugs with R code.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to export data.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What will I not learn to do in R?<a href="#what-will-i-not-learn-to-do-in-r" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This is not an exhaustive introduction to R. Similar to human languages, programming languages like R are vast and will take years to master. After this course, you will still be considered a “newbie” in R. But the material covered here will at least provide you a solid foundation in R, enabling you to go ahead and pick up further skills if required as you go on.</p>
<p>This course will teach you data cleaning and wrangling skills that will enable you to wrangle and clean a lot of data collected on Gorilla or Qualtrics. But you will not be able to easily handle all data cleaning problems you are likely to find out in the “wild” world of messy data. Such datasets can be uniquely messy, and even experienced R programmers will need to bash their head against the wall a few times to figure out a way to clean that dataset entirely in R. If you have a particularly messy dataset, you might still need to use other programmes (e.g., Excel) to clean it up first before importing it to R.</p>
<p>Similarly, do not expect to be fluent in the concepts you learn here after these workshops. It will take practice to become fluent. You might need to refer to these materials or look up help repeatedly when using R on real-life datasets. That’s normal.</p>
<p>This workshop is heavily focused on the tidyverse approach to R. The tidyverse is a particular philosophical approach to how to use R (more on that later). The other approach would be to use base R. This can incite violent debates in R communities on which approach is better. We will focus mainly on tidyverse and use some base R.</p>
<p>This workshop does not teach you how to use R Markdown. R Markdown is a package in R that enables you to write reproducible and dynamic reports with R that can be converted into Word documents, PDFs, websites, PowerPoint presentations, books, and much more. That will be covered in the intermediate workshop programme.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Why are we learning R?<a href="#why-are-we-learning-r" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There are many reasons to learn R.</p>
<p>Psychological research is increasingly moving towards open-science practices. One of the key principles of open-science is that all aspects of data handling - including data wrangling, pre-processing, processing, and output generation - are openly accessible. This is not only an abstract want or desire; several top-tier journals require that you submit R scripts along with any manuscripts. If you don’t know how to use R (or at least no one in your lab does), then this may put you at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>R enables you to import, clean, analyse, and publish manuscripts from R itself. You do not have to switch between SPSS, Excel, and Word or any other software. You can conduct your statistical analysis directly in R and have that “uploaded” directly to your manuscript. In the long run, this will save you so much time and energy.</p>
<p>R is capable of more than statistical analysis. You can create websites, documents, and books in R. This e-book was developed in R! While these initial workshops will not be discussing how to do this (although it is something that I would like to do in the future), I wanted to mention it as an example of how powerful R can be.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Where and when will the workshops take place?<a href="#where-and-when-will-the-workshops-take-place" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The sessions will take place in <strong>AMB-G035</strong> (Psychology PC Suite). The schedule for the sessions is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feb 7th: Introduction to R and RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>Feb 14th: R Programming (Part I)</p></li>
<li><p>Feb 21st: R Programming (Part II)</p></li>
<li><p>Feb 28th: Data Cleaning in R (Part I)</p></li>
<li><p>March 6th: Data Cleaning in R (Part II)</p></li>
<li><p>March 13th: Data Visualization</p></li>
<li><p>March 20th: Running Inferential Statistical Tests in R (Part I)</p></li>
<li><p>March 27th: Running Inferential Statistical Tests in R (Part II)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each session is on a Wednesday and will run between 11:00 - 13:00.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Are there any prerequisites for taking this course?<a href="#are-there-any-prerequisites-for-taking-this-course" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>None at all. This course is beginner-friendly. You also do not need to purchase anything (e.g., textbooks or software).</p>
</div>
<div id="do-i-need-to-bring-a-laptop-to-the-class" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Do I need to bring a laptop to the class?<a href="#do-i-need-to-bring-a-laptop-to-the-class" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>If you have a laptop that you work on, I strongly encourage you to bring it. That way, we can get R and RStudio installed onto your laptop, and you’ll be able to run R outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>If you work with a desktop, don’t worry. The lab space will have computers that you can sign in and work on and use R.</p>
